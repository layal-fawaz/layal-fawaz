<p>
A front-end developer with a growing passion for building clean, beautiful, and user-friendly interfaces.<br>

Iâ€™m currently working on a full-stack project for an optical system using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and MySQL.
Iâ€™m currently learning about the QA field and how to integrate AI into my technical path.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web projects that focus on front-end development and enhancing user experience.
Iâ€™m looking for help in Quality Assurance (QA), including learning advanced testing strategies and effective testing tools.
