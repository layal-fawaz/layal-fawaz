<h1>Hi there, I'm Layal 👋🏻</h1>

💫 About Me<br>
A QA Tester passionate about ensuring software is reliable, bug-free, and delivers a smooth user experience.  
My background in **software development** helps me understand code structure and application behavior, which allows me to **identify issues effectively** and improve overall software quality.  
<br>
I work with **Manual and Automation Testing**, Java (JUnit), SpotBugs, Checkstyle, and web technologies — and I actively use **AI tools** across many areas of my work, including **testing, automation, analyzing code, improving processes, creating documentation, and supporting software quality**.

I care deeply about precision and quality, and I love turning ideas into **polished, reliable software experiences** ✨  

I’m looking to collaborate on projects focused on **software testing, QA, and improving user experience**, and I’m excited to explore how AI can help create **innovative and impactful solutions**.
