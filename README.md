ðŸ’« About Me:
A front-end developer passionate about building clean, beautiful, and user-friendly interfaces.
I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind, PHP, and JavaFX â€” and Iâ€™ve started integrating AI into many areas of my life and work, including programming, video production, image creation, marketing, educational content, storytelling, as well as designing interfaces and creative visuals.

I care deeply about design details and love turning ideas into polished experiences âœ¨

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web projects focused on front-end development and enhancing user experience. Iâ€™m excited to explore the endless possibilities AI offers across diverse fields and create innovative, impactful solutions.
